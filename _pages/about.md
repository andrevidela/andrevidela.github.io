I'm interested in dependent types, programming languages, user experience and user interfaces, compiler architecture, lenses, quantitative types, and more.

You can find me on discord (identity5193) and mastodon [@andrev@types.pl](https://types.pl/@Andrev/).

## Current projects

- Sometimes, I work on [Idris2](http://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2), mostly to resolve
  the problems that I encounter myself with the language
- My PhD Thesis is about [_Monadic programming in the category of containers_](https://gitlab.com/avidela/container-compendium)
- I'm interested in the ergonomics and the semantics of programming, in particular [servers backends](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15633),
  data description languages, and [compilers](https://cybercat.institute/2024/04/08/modular-error-reporting/)
